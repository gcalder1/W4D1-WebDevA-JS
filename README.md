# W4D1-WebDevA-JS

## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

* This is a GitHub repo made for the Week 4 Day 1 of Web Dev A - Innovation Fellowship class, where we are beginning our journey with JavaScript.
  * We learned about different situation where one would use variables as well as what their declarations mean.
* This repository houses the files for a finished Drumkit (based on the JS30 challenge).
  * The files for all of the drumkit related things are inside of here such as the sounds, background image, the HTML, the CSS, and the internal JS
